Coding challenge

To run the code, simply download the index file and open it in any browser. You can browse through different stores while dragging and dropping items in the shopping cart. Once ready, press "Place Order" button. It will ask you to enter a pick up time and then show you an alert. 

I have comments on major areas in the code to help you understand my process of implementation. I tried to pay more attention to the functionality than the design as the former is more complex.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
